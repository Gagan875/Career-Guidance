## Usage in Application

### Quiz Selection Modal
The `QuizSelectionModal` component provides two options:
1. **Stream Selection Quiz** (After Class 10) → Routes to `/quiz`
2. **Field Selection Quiz** (After Class 12) → Routes to `/field-quiz`

### Integration Steps
1. Create `FieldQuiz.js` page component (similar to Quiz.js)
2. Create API routes in `server/routes/fieldQuiz.js`
3. Update `App.js` to include the field quiz route
4. Update modal to route to `/field-quiz` for button 2

## API Endpoints (To be created)

```javascript
// Get random field questions
GET /api/field-quiz/random?userId=xxx

// Submit field quiz
POST /api/field-quiz/submit

// Get field quiz results
GET /api/field-quiz/results
```

## Benefits

1. **Separate Database**: Field questions are isolated from stream questions
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 500 questions across 15 career fields
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more questions or fields
4. **Categorized**: Questions organized by field and category
5. **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, medium, and hard questions for better assessment

## Next Steps

1. Create FieldQuiz page component
2. Create API routes for field quiz
3. Update QuizSelectionModal routing
4. Add field quiz results to user profile
5. Create field-specific recommendations based on quiz results

## Notes

- Questions are stored in MongoDB collection: `fieldquestions`
- Each question has a unique `_id` generated by MongoDB
- Questions can be filtered by field, difficulty, and category
- The `isActive` flag allows for enabling/disabling questions without deletion
